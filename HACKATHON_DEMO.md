## QUESTIONS YOU'LL GET ASKED

### Q: "Why voice?"
**A:** "Most people check health apps on the go. Voice is hands-free and feels like talking to a real doctor."

**A:** "ChatGPT doesn't understand health data. Lora integrates with your actual health metrics from Apple Health, so she gives personalized answers based on your real data."

### Q: "What about privacy with ElevenLabs?"
**A:** "Only AI-generated text is sent. Raw health data never leaves the device. Plus users can use fully local mode."

### Q: "How much would this cost to run?"
**A:** "API costs are $0.30-1.00 per user per month for voice. Very economical at scale."

### Q: "Can you add X feature?"
**A:** "Absolutely, here's how we'd approach it: [explain architecture]. It's built modularly so new features are easy."
